Practiced retrieving Spotify data through Spotify API in Python. After getting all the data (csv files), I decided to create a Tableau dashboard just to see if the "vibes" of each playlist match the title of the playlist. For example, it made a lot of sense that all playlists except my study playlist had little instrumentalness. It also made sense that my party playlist had the highest danceability.
